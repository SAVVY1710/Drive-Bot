## 11/8/2025 - Made a plan/outline of the project  

I made an outline of my design idea and drew sketches showing how the parts connect and what components I might use. The drawings helped me see how everything would fit together and spot any problems, like parts being too close or wiring getting messy. I also wrote down what materials and power sources I might need, along with backup options if certain parts don’t work out. Doing this helped me understand my design better and what I need to fix before I start building.
