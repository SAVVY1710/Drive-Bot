## 11/8/2025 8 PM - Made a plan/outline of the project  

I made an outline of my design idea and drew sketches showing how the parts connect and what components I might use. The drawings helped me see how everything would fit together and spot any problems, like parts being too close or wiring getting messy. I also wrote down what materials and power sources I might need, along with backup options if certain parts don’t work out. Doing this helped me understand my design better and what I need to fix before I start building.

## 11/8/2025 10 PM - Came up with a parts list and do research  

I spent a lot of time looking for the best and cheapest parts for my project before ordering them. I compared prices from different places and read reviews to make sure the parts were good quality and would work well together. I also checked things like the size and power ratings so I wouldn’t have problems when building. It took a while, but it helped me stay on budget and feel sure that I picked the right parts for my design.
